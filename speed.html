Speed is a 1994 American action film directed by Jan de Bont in his feature film directorial debut. The film stars Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper, Sandra Bullock, Joe Morton, and Jeff Daniels. Its story revolves around a bus that is rigged by a terrorist to explode if its speed falls below 50 miles per hour.
    
The film premiered in Hollywood on June 7, 1994, and was released in the rest of the United States on June 10, 1994, it became critically and commercially successful, grossing $350.4 million on a $30â€“37 million budget, becoming the fifth-highest-grossing film of 1994 and winning two Academy Awards for Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Sound. The film also solidified Reeves as an action movie leading man. A sequel, Speed 2: Cruise Control, was released three years later on June 13, 1997, without Reeves' involvement. David Edelstein considered it to be the worst sequel of all time.[4]
