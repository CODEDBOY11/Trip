Extraction 2 is a 2023 American action thriller film directed by Sam Hargrave and written by Joe Russo, based on the graphic novel Ciudad by Ande Parks, Joe Russo, Anthony Russo, Fernando León González, and Eric Skillman. A sequel to the 2020 film Extraction, it stars Chris Hemsworth, Golshifteh Farahani and Adam Bessa, reprising their roles from the first film, along with Tornike Gogrichiani, Tinatin Dalakishvili, Daniel Bernhardt, Olga Kurylenko and Idris Elba joining the cast. In the film, Tyler Rake (Hemsworth) is initially hired to rescue the family of an abusive crime lord from a Georgian prison.
    Following the successful debut of the first film, Netflix announced a sequel in May 2020 with Joe Russo returning to write, Hargrave returning to direct and Hemsworth returning in the lead. By December, Joe and his brother Anthony hoped that the sequel would develop the characters enough to start a cinematic universe. Filming was scheduled to begin in Sydney in September 2021, but was delayed by the COVID-19 Pandemic and eventually started in Prague in November, before concluding in Vienna on April 2022. In addition to the returns of the Russos, Hargrave and Hemsworth, Henry Jackman and Alex Belcher returned to compose the score.

Extraction 2 was released by Netflix on 16 June 2023 and received generally positive reviews from critics.
